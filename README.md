[//]: # (demonstrating some cool markdown syntax tricks. this is a markdown comment)

This ReadMe file was generated using:
- **Markdown**, a fun and easy-to-learn language that creates appealing ReadMe documents
- **node.js**, a way to run server-side JavaScript functions
> Who doesn't ~~like~~ _love_ a good ReadMe?&nbsp;

## <a id="description-id"></a>Description
This application is a professional ReadMe.md generator run from the userâ€™s local CLI. This project was created to demonstrate the use of node.js, a server-side way to run JavaScript functions. It is also is a way of demonstrating Markdown, a fun and easy-to-use language similar to HTML. Markdown is the language used to create ReadMe files. This project taught me more about Markdownâ€™s syntax, the importance of a ReadMe, how to install node onto my computer and how to run simple node commands. I will use this project in the future to create ReadMe files for my own projects as well as refer to this code when running node.js commands or using Markdown syntax.
   
## <a id="installation-id"></a>Installation
To use this application, you must download node onto your local machine. Please visit https://nodejs.org/en/ to install. You will also need VSCode: (https://code.visualstudio.com/download), npm inquirer package: (run â€˜npm i inquirer@8.2.4â€™ in your CLI), and a copy of my code: (https://github.com/ScottsC0de/readme-machine)
    
## <a id="usage-id"></a>Usage
With node installed, you can now run node commands on JavaScript files. To use this app, you must be in its file from the CLI or an app that allows you to run CLI commands. For this app, we used VSCodeâ€™s Integrated Terminal. If you are using VSCode, right click on the index.js file and click â€˜Open In Integrated Terminalâ€™. Run a node index.js command to begin creating your ReadMe file. Answer all prompts and watch the magic happen.
